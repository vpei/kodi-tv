<*tap, tap, tap*> - Is this thing on? Yes, it is, and so it's time to once again introduce the highlight of the Kodi year - friends and fellow travellers, welcome to DevCon 2025! 

This year we're coming to you from Tirana in Albania (or *Tiranë* in *Shqipëri* in the local language†). A country that, I suspect, most people know little about, Albania has a long and ... bumpy history, mostly involving other countries and some less-than-friendly regimes: Romans (both western Roman and eastern Byzantine), Ottomans, Austro-Hungarians, Italians, from imperial territory to independence, from international capitalism to isolationist communism and back. Sitting astride both the Aegean and Ionic seas, the country now embraces the promise of full modernity and EU membership as it strives to turn its back on the darker chapters of recent history and take its rightful place in Europe.

As in previous years, we're going to aim to do a daily update (content-dependent), so let's see how it goes. Without further ado, then, let's get straight into it with Day One.

We began with round-table introductions and a typical retrospective: reminiscences for older heads, background for newer ones. We're coming up to a  quarter of a century of XBMC/Kodi, and, as you'd expect, there's now a significant story of how we got to where we are, and some of the main contributors and contributions along the way.

We continued with an update on the Foundation's financial position from **keithah**. We've always been very transparent that we're not a wealthy project, and we've never actively pursued financial gain for either Foundation or individuals. That hasn't changed, although money is gradually getting tighter as e.g. major sponsors fall away, with limited opportunity to replace them in the current climate. We remain solvent, and can both pay our bills and invest in development hardware, server infrastructure and, yes, this conference, but we do need to generate new and more regular income to make sure that remains the case. In terms of priority, then, we wait to see if this is the last DevCon for a while. 

Next up, we had a readout on the experience of our most recent release manager, **garbear**. Getting Kodi tagged, packaged and released on multiple platforms is a significant undertaking, so even point releases involve a good chunk of work. Even apparently minor changes involve merging new translations, for example, plus there are inevitable rule/eligibility checks on software stores and similar. Indeed, our most recent "Omega" 21.2 release actually included a complete update to the entire add-on ecosystem precisely because of translation issues, which means 100+ separate components needed to be built and released alongside the core Kodi application. Even that caused further ripple effects: we needed to update binary add-ons as well, which then, in turn, caused problems for existing 21.1 installations. This led straight into a more practical conversation, with **garbear** joined primarily by **martijn**, **yol** and **lrusak** to talk about how we could improve things: APIs, ABIs, links, scripts, dependencies, redistributables, SDKs, implications for different platforms. Releasing new versions of Kodi is most certainly not a trivial task!

*† Fun fact: Albanian is the only surviving member of the [Albanoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanoid) group of languages, and so stands alone, with no direct modern relatives. It's the official language of Albania and Kosovo, one of the official languages in North Macedonia and Montenegro, and a widespread minority language in Italy, Croatia, Romania, Serbia and Greece. Add in the Albanian diaspora across the Americas, Europe and Oceania, and there are three or four times more native speakers worldwide than there are inhabitants of modern Albania - including singers [Dua Lipa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dua_Lipa) and [Rita Ora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_Ora).*
